How to use the programs in this project:

1. git clone https://github.com/chihoon1/unsupervised_learning.git # install this git repo to local computer
2. python -m venv venv # set up virtual environment for python project
3. source venv/bin/active  # activate virtual environment
4. pip install -r requirements.txt # install all the library packages needed in this project
5. invoke any unsupervised learning ML algorithm functions in the project


The implementations of unsupervised learning algorithms are tested in the .py file where algorithms are implemented or in .ipynb file
